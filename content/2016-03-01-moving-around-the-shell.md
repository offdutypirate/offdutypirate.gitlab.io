Summary: Using more than just left and right arrow to move around on the shell.
Published: true

Everything here was taken from the *Command Line Editing* section of the bash manual.  I strongly advise you go there for all the things I've left out.

### Basic movement
- Move back a single character `Ctrl` + `b`
- Move forward a single character `Ctrl` + `f`

### Search command history
- `Ctrl` + `r` and type the search term.  Press `Ctrl` + `r` to cycle through results.
- `Ctrl` + `j` ends the search on the current entry
- `Ctrl` + `g` cancels the search
